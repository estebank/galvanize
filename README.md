## Galvanize: Pure Rust CDB library

Manipulate [DJB's Constant Database](http://cr.yp.to/cdb.html) files. These are
2 level disk-based hash tables that efficiently handle thousands of keys, while
remaining space-efficient.

Constant databases have the desirable property of requiring low overhead to
open.
